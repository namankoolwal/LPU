# The code is assigning the value 100 to the variable `x`, the value 200 to the variable `y`, and then
# adding `x` and `y` together and assigning the result to the variable `z`. Finally, it prints the

# The code you mentioned is commented out, which means it is not being executed. However, if you
# uncomment it by removing the `#` symbols, it will perform the following actions:

# print ("address of x = " , id(x))
# print ("address of y = " , id(y))

# if x is z :
#     # print("both are having same value")
# else:
#     # print("both are having different value")

# The code is creating a list `a` with the values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 55, 66, 77, 100]`. Then, it checks if
# the value `4` is present in the list `a` using the `in` operator. The result of this check is
# assigned to the variable `z`. Finally, it prints the value of `z`, which will be `True` if `4` is in
# the list `a`, and `False` otherwise.
